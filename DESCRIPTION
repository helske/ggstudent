Description: Provides an extension to ggplot2 
    (Wickham, 2016, <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4>) for creating two 
    types of continuous confidence interval plots, typically for sample mean.
    The plots contains multiple user-defined confidence areas with varying colors, 
    defined by the underlying t-distribution used to compute standard confidence intervals for mean of normal distribution when variance is unknown.
    Two types of plots are available, a gradient plot with rectangular areas, and violin plot where the 
    shape (horizontal width) is defined by the probability density function of the t-distribution.
