Description: Provides an extension to 'ggplot2' (Wickham, 2016, <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4>) for creating two 
    types of continuous confidence interval plots (Violin CI and Gradient CI plots), typically for the sample mean.
    These plots contain multiple user-defined confidence areas with varying colours, 
    defined by the underlying t-distribution used to compute standard confidence intervals for 
    the mean of the normal distribution when the variance is unknown.
    Two types of plots are available, a gradient plot with rectangular areas, and a violin plot where the 
    shape (horizontal width) is defined by the probability density function of the t-distribution.
